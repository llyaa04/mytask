               <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
                Its a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
                Most coronaviruses aren't dangerousThe disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing.
                You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
                Animal source of Covid-19 has not yet been identified, but the original host is thought to be bats.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing, and some cases have caused death.
                In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus.
                The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
               COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
               It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
               It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact.
               Infections range from mild to deadly.</p>
               <p>SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.</p>

              The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. 
              Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. 
              This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.
               They can kill tissue and damage your organs.Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19.
               If you’re infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.
